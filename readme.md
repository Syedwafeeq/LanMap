# 🚀 LanMap — Simple LAN Scanner in Python

A lightweight and scalable **Python-based Local Area Network (LAN) Scanner** that discovers devices on your network by pinging all hosts connected to your gateway. Perfect for network exploration, automation projects, security scanning tools, and educational use.

✨ **Easy to use | Lightweight | Extensible | Python Script**

---

## 🔍 What Does LanMap Do?

LanMap is a basic Python script that **scans your local network**, identifies active devices/nodes, and collects basic information about them.

It:

* Sends **pings** to every possible IP on your LAN
* Detects which nodes respond
* Collects responses into a dictionary
* Can be integrated into other scripts & tools
* Helps you quickly map out connected devices

💡 This project is ideal for network admins, cybersecurity beginners, automation engineers, and Python developers. ([GitHub][1])

## 🛠 Features

✔️ Simple and lightweight Python script
✔️ Requires only the network **gateway**
✔️ Scalable — can be reused inside other tools
✔️ Outputs quick device discovery results
✔️ No external database or services needed

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 📦 Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed (3.x recommended).

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### ▶️ Run the Scanner

```bash
python net_in_trial.py
```

Follow the prompts to enter your network gateway and start scanning.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

LanMap sends ICMP echo requests (`ping`) to all hosts within your LAN and stores info about the ones that reply. This helps you quickly identify **live devices** on your network. ([GitHub][1])

## 💡 Use Cases

⭐ **Network Discovery Scripts**
⭐ **IoT Network Mapping**
⭐ **Cybersecurity Learning Tool**
⭐ **Automation / Monitoring Tools**
⭐ **Integration into Larger Projects**
